# Benchmark


## Usage

- Create a folder for each inputfile you'd like to benchmark, and copy the inputfile into the folder
- Run the script `benchmark.sh`
- Wait with a cup of coffee, check the output from time to time 
- Done.

**NOTE**: The name of the folder must be in the format `name_XxYxZ_cycle`, as the script relies on the second segment to launch MPI processes.

## Baseline

There're few baseline files in this folder, which can be used as a reference for performance evaluation.
